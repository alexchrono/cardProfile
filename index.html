<h1>PERSONALITY!</h1>
Ember is a gentleman, studious about others as well as he can be, learning about the world around him through the eyes of a lobotomized primal sentience. Cardinal is a greedy plotting bastard, the only person that matters is himself. Invoking names is a mistake.

<div id="02" class="dragon">
<h1>HISTORY!</h1>
<s>Cardinal</s> lived a life of conquest, going from a free living solar leviathan to a beast well aware his genocidal rampage would come back to haunt him. Haunt him indeed, it did. After a fair few issues with adventurers hunting him down, he went for the rest. An entire planet lay waste to carnage as the planet and everything on it endured the rage of a full fledged sun. The planet, flora, fauna, and all manner of energies on it had turned against its protector, starting with the humans who wished to manifest their own destiny without being asked not to do such damage to their home. The creators, theologies of each kind placed him beneath a life of servitude and kindness and rended his very essence in two. Those who interact with the formerly glorious Beast have met Ember, a gentleman who prefers company over visual silence, and a quest to find those who may understand him. <s>Cardinal</s> as it were, remains chained beneath pillars of each faith to atone for killing each and every follower they had. Having gone against his primary directive of protecting the rock in space, he turned against it, punished the very stone beneath him for lashing out when he tried to help. Perhaps one may see him, as blue eyes melt to gold, two parts of the same mind conferring before actions. Tempting the original sinner from beneath his confines to pilot his body as a whole soul once more. Gentle however? Not necessarily.
<p></p>
Ember operates on a 'hard magic' system, everything he does he has been able to do and will likely be able to do for the duration of the character. Some things arent mentioned or arent used as often, but things dont just 'pop up' for convenience, this is a promise.
